// what is Ajax?
// Ajax : Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
// it take some time to get data from API so to continue the work its important to make it dynamic which is basically AJax call

// in past the api request come back in the form of XML thats why its name is Ajax but technally it should be AJAJ (Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON)

// Http verbs
// GET : get the data
// POST : add the data
// PUT : update the data
// DELETE : delete the data
// we can see example of it using HOPPSCOTCH
