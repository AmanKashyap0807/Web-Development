## In initially we will practice on console
***console is based on REPL concept : Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop***
**all the code on the webpage console is temporary**

## Some terms

- **Variable** : Name of the storage location
- **Data Types** : Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, Null : these are the primitive type of Data types
- - Memory Size of Number :
-  **Operator Precedence** : () > ** > *,/,% > +,-
-  **Associativity** : Left to right in above cluster
-  Its etiquates to use let for creation of variable and end with semicolon to represent that the line ends here
-  **const** : when we are defining constant, can not be redefined later, fix value
-  **var** : old way to define variable in javascript
-  **comments** : // for creating comments
-  **Assignment Operator** : =

-  ++a, --a : change then use
-  **Identifier** : as same as c++ : valid identifier : age,_age,$age
-  **Ways to define identifier** : camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase
-  **Boolean Datatype** : store values in boolean( true/false ) : Be carefull there are small t and f 
-  javascript is a dynamic typed language, means data type can be changed for any variable
-  **TypeScript** : strict version of javascript where we can't change the data type of any variable
-  **String** : ' or " both can be used to store either letter or a word or a sentence, dont mix
-  **empty string** : valid string
-  sentence including quotes will be defined by another quotes on outer side
-   double quotes ke andar double quotes not valid, same for single quotes
-   **String Indicies** : follows 0 based indexing, space also take a index
-   accessing perticular indes : a[index], for out of range it will give Undefined
-   **undefined** : whcih is not defined
-   **Null** : Null is a value which is Undefined but given to a var intentionally
-    

## Some Command

- **up/down ward key** : same as terminal
- **typeof** : type of the variable
- **Modulo** : return remainder of a number devided by another
- **Exponenet** : Return power of a number ( base**power )
- **Nan** : Not-A-Number : is a number of javascript but not represent a valid number ( 0/0, Nan+1, Nan*Nan )
- **string.length** : give the length of the letters, how many lettes are there
