### Local package installation
- installation of package in local directory
- it can be used only under that directory not outside of it
- its a good practice

### global package installation
- ***npm install -g **package_name*****
- global level
- still we can't use it from anywhere
- we need to link the package : ***npm link package_name***
- rarely used
