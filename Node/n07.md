Till now we have learnt how to require the exported content from a file or folder
We either use require or import in a project, don't do both

**step 1 :** from the resource file we write export keyword in initialization of funtion of info instead of export.modules
**step 2 :** ***import { comma_seprated_names_of_info } from "./path/filename.extension"***

by this we can choose which thing we want to import instead of requireing everything

**Note :** for using this there is need of package.json file in the directory which include 
"type" : "module"

- import is better
- some npm package only support import
