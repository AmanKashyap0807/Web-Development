***Express is a Framework not a library***
Used for server side programming

## library : 
- A set of code/functions that you call when needed for specific functionality
- You maintain control over your application flow
- You decide when and where to use the library
- Examples: jQuery, Lodash, Moment.js

## framework : 
- A structural foundation where your code fits into its architecture
- Controls the flow of the application and calls your code when needed (inversion of control)
- Provides a standardized way to build and deploy applications
- Dictates the overall structure and patterns of your application
- Examples: Express.js, Angular, React (technically a library but often used with supporting tools as a framework)
